#### Performance Bottlenecks

**Issue:** Synchronous API Request
- **Context:** `response = requests.get(url)`
- **Description:** The API request is made synchronously, which can cause the program to wait for a response before continuing execution.
- **Suggested Fix:** Consider using asynchronous requests or implementing a threading mechanism to make concurrent API requests and improve performance.

#### Variable Naming Consistency

**Issue:** Inconsistent Variable Naming
- **Context:** `access_token`, `username`, `user_info`
- **Description:** The variable names do not follow a consistent naming convention.
- **Suggested Fix:** Rename variables to adhere to a consistent style, like snake_case: `access_token`, `username`, `user_info`.

#### Comments Review

**Issue:** Lack of Detailed Comments
- **Context:** Class and method docstrings
- **Description:** The comments lack detailed explanations of the purpose, behavior, and expected inputs/outputs of the class and methods.
- **Suggested Fix:** Add more detailed comments to provide clarity and improve code documentation.

#### Potential Refactoring Spots

**Issue:** Hard-coded API URL
- **Context:** `url = f"https://api.instagram.com/v1/users/{username}/?access_token={self.access_token}"`
- **Description:** The API URL is hard-coded within the method, making it less flexible and reusable.
- **Suggested Fix:** Consider moving the API URL to a separate constant or configuration file to improve maintainability and allow for easier modification.

#### API Misuse

**Issue:** Incomplete Error Handling
- **Context:** Error handling in `get_user_info` method
- **Description:** The exception handling does not differentiate between different types of errors, making it harder to handle specific exceptions.
- **Suggested Fix:** Implement specific exception handling for different types of errors, such as network errors, JSON parsing errors, or API response errors.

#### Code Smells

**Issue:** Redundant Error Raising
- **Context:** `raise Exception(f"Error accessing user information: {str(e)}")`
- **Description:** The exception is caught and immediately re-raised without any additional handling or modification.
- **Suggested Fix:** Consider handling the exception locally or adding additional information before re-raising the exception.

#### Compatibility Issues

**Issue:** API Version Dependency
- **Context:** `url = f"https://api.instagram.com/v1/users/{username}/?access_token={self.access_token}"`
- **Description:** The code relies on the Instagram API version 1 (`v1`), which may become deprecated or unsupported in the future.
- **Suggested Fix:** Keep track of Instagram API updates and adjust the code accordingly to ensure compatibility with newer versions.

#### Code Style Violations

**Issue:** Inconsistent Indentation
- **Context:** Inconsistent indentation throughout the code.
- **Description:** The code has inconsistent indentation, which can make it harder to read and understand.
- **Suggested Fix:** Use consistent indentation (e.g., 4 spaces or tabs) throughout the codebase to improve readability and maintainability.
